# Please send your contributions! :pray:

Here are several steps to make sure while making a pull request:

### Update the `README` file
The README file has two places it needs to be updated when you add new bindings:
* Its header has a badge with the amount of bindings provided, compared to the original `Faker.js` (X out of Y). If you updated 3, please add 3 to the number!
* Add usage steps for your contribution later in the file

### Add tests!
Faker generates random strings. Try to catch what you can with regular expressions or just type checking

### Describe your contribution in the pull request
Please give an informative title.
Also, if you're resolving/fixing an issue, please mention the issue by adding `Fixes #ISSUE_ID` in the description body.
